# Infrastructure Configuration
Generated by Rig CLI AI Create

## Overview
Set up an infrastructure for Node.js project in GCP

### Environments
- dev
- staging
- prod

### Components
- compute
- database
- storage
- networking
- monitoring

## Project Information
- **Type**: Node.js
- **Tech Stack**: JavaScript/Node.js
- **Cloud Provider**: GCP

## Directory Structure
```
/Volumes/ExternalSSD/hw/devops-sre/devops-cli/infrastructure/



└── cicd/
    └── .github/workflows/
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.0 (if using Terraform)
- kubectl (if using Kubernetes)
- Docker (if using containers)
- GCloud CLI configured with appropriate permissions

### Deployment Steps







## Environment Configuration

### Dev Environment
- **Purpose**: Development and testing
- **Scaling**: Manual scaling
- **Backup**: Manual backups
- **Monitoring**: Basic monitoring

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Scaling**: Manual scaling
- **Backup**: Manual backups
- **Monitoring**: Basic monitoring

### Prod Environment
- **Purpose**: Production workloads
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling enabled
- **Backup**: Automated backups enabled
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring and alerting


## Security Considerations
- All environments use private subnets for compute resources
- Databases are not publicly accessible
- Secrets are managed through Secret Manager
- Firewall rules restrict access to necessary ports only
- Production uses encrypted storage and backups

## Cost Optimization
- Development uses minimal resources
- Staging mimics production but with reduced redundancy
- Production uses auto-scaling to optimize costs
- Storage lifecycle policies automatically clean up old data

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Centralized logging to Cloud Storage
- Metrics dashboards for all environments
- Production alerts for high CPU and memory usage
- Custom alerts can be configured in the monitoring module

## CI/CD Integration
The generated GitHub Actions workflows provide:
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Security scanning
- Deployment to respective environments
- Manual approval for production deployments

## Recommendations
- Implement CI/CD pipeline using Google Cloud Build and Source Repositories
- Set up environment separation using different Google Cloud Projects
- Set up billing alerts

## Support
For issues or questions:
- Review the generated configurations
- Check the Rig CLI documentation
- Run `rig troubleshoot` for common issues
