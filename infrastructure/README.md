## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Terraform >= 1.0 (if using Terraform)
- kubectl (if using Kubernetes)
- Docker (if using containers)
- GCloud CLI configured with appropriate permissions

### Deployment Steps

#### Terraform Deployment
1. Navigate to the environment directory:
   ```bash
   cd terraform/dev  # or staging/prod
   ```

2. Copy and customize the terraform.tfvars:
   ```bash
   cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
   # Edit terraform.tfvars with your values
   ```

3. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

4. Review the plan:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

5. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```






## Environment Configuration

### Dev Environment
- **Purpose**: Development and testing
- **Scaling**: Manual scaling
- **Backup**: Manual backups
- **Monitoring**: Basic monitoring

### Staging Environment
- **Purpose**: Pre-production testing
- **Scaling**: Manual scaling
- **Backup**: Manual backups
- **Monitoring**: Basic monitoring

### Prod Environment
- **Purpose**: Production workloads
- **Scaling**: Auto-scaling enabled
- **Backup**: Automated backups enabled
- **Monitoring**: Full monitoring and alerting


## Security Considerations
- All environments use private subnets for compute resources
- Databases are not publicly accessible
- Secrets are managed through Secret Manager
- Firewall rules restrict access to necessary ports only
- Production uses encrypted storage and backups

## Cost Optimization
- Development uses minimal resources
- Staging mimics production but with reduced redundancy
- Production uses auto-scaling to optimize costs
- Storage lifecycle policies automatically clean up old data

## Monitoring and Alerts
- Centralized logging to Cloud Storage
- Metrics dashboards for all environments
- Production alerts for high CPU and memory usage
- Custom alerts can be configured in the monitoring module

## CI/CD Integration
The generated GitHub Actions workflows provide:
- Automated testing on pull requests
- Security scanning
- Deployment to respective environments
- Manual approval for production deployments

## Recommendations
- As Docker and Kubernetes are not initially required, a more straightforward infrastructure might be preferred such as Terraform, which will handle the Infrastructure as Code (IaC).
- Securing the cloud environment via cloud IAM and ensuring security in all layers (Data, Application, OS, and Network).
- Consider implementing CI/CD pipelines and automated testing for efficient development and to minimize human error.
- Consider setting up a staging environment that mirrors production as closely as possible to validate the performance and functionality before deployment to production.
- Automated backups should be implemented for the database and key components of the infrastructure.
