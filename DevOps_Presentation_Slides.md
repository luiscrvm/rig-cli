# Slide 1: Title
## DevOps: Accelerating Time to Value
### Terraform & CI/CD with Automated Infrastructure Generation

**Scaffold Infrastructure in Seconds, Not Days**

🚀 Rig CLI - Infrastructure as Code Automation

---

# Slide 2: Agenda
## What We'll Cover Today

1. **The Problem** - Manual Infrastructure Pain
2. **The Solution** - Automated IaC Generation  
3. **Terraform Modules** - Instant Scaffolding
4. **CI/CD Pipelines** - One-Command Setup
5. **Sandbox Environments** - Self-Service Infrastructure
6. **Live Demo** - See It In Action
7. **Business Impact** - ROI & Metrics

---

# Slide 3: The Problem
## Manual Infrastructure Setup Is Killing Velocity

### Current Reality:
- **8-16 hours** to set up new environments
- **70% of incidents** from configuration drift
- **3-5 days** for sandbox provisioning
- **Copy-paste** Terraform modules

---

# Slide 4: The Cost of Manual Work
## What This Means for Your Business

💸 **$250,000/year** in lost developer productivity

⏰ **2 weeks delay** per new service deployment

🔥 **4x more** production incidents

😤 **Developer frustration** and turnover

---

# Slide 5: Enter Rig CLI
## Your Infrastructure Automation Assistant

```bash
rig generate --analyze
```

**One command generates:**
- ✅ Complete Terraform modules
- ✅ CI/CD pipelines
- ✅ Kubernetes manifests
- ✅ Security configurations
- ✅ Monitoring setup

---

# Slide 6: How It Works
## Intelligent Code Analysis

1. **Scans** your repository
2. **Detects** technology stack
3. **Analyzes** dependencies
4. **Generates** best-practice configurations
5. **Validates** against security standards

**Time: < 60 seconds**

---

# Slide 7: Terraform Generation - Before
## The Old Way

```hcl
# Hours of manual writing...
# Copy from old projects
# Google for examples
# Debug syntax errors
# Miss security settings
```

**Result:** Inconsistent, insecure, time-consuming

---

# Slide 8: Terraform Generation - After
## The Rig CLI Way

```bash
rig generate terraform
```

**Instant generation of:**
```
terraform/
├── modules/
│   ├── networking/
│   ├── compute/
│   └── database/
└── environments/
    ├── dev/
    ├── staging/
    └── production/
```

---

# Slide 9: Generated Terraform Features
## Production-Ready from the Start

- **Multi-environment** support (dev/staging/prod)
- **Modular architecture** for reusability
- **State management** with remote backends
- **Security by default** (encryption, IAM)
- **Import existing** resources

---

# Slide 10: Real Terraform Example
## What Gets Generated

```hcl
# modules/compute/main.tf
resource "google_compute_instance" "app" {
  name         = var.instance_name
  machine_type = var.machine_type
  
  boot_disk {
    initialize_params {
      image = var.boot_image
      size  = var.disk_size
    }
  }
  
  network_interface {
    subnetwork = var.subnet_id
  }
  
  metadata_startup_script = file("${path.module}/startup.sh")
}
```

---

# Slide 11: CI/CD Pipeline Generation
## From Zero to Deploy in 2 Minutes

```bash
rig generate cicd
```

**Creates complete pipelines for:**
- GitHub Actions
- GitLab CI
- Jenkins
- Azure DevOps

---

# Slide 12: Generated Pipeline Features
## Enterprise-Grade CI/CD

```yaml
name: Deploy Infrastructure
on: [push]

jobs:
  test:
    - Run unit tests
    - Security scanning
    - Terraform validate
    
  deploy:
    - Terraform plan
    - Manual approval
    - Terraform apply
    - Smoke tests
```

---

# Slide 13: Multi-Stage Deployments
## Built-In Environment Promotion

```
Dev → Staging → Production
```

---

# Slide 14: Sandbox Environments
## Self-Service Infrastructure

### The Problem:
"I need a test environment" → 3-5 day wait

### The Solution:
```bash
rig generate terraform -o ./sandbox/my-env
terraform apply
```

**Result:** Complete environment in 10 minutes

---

# Slide 15: Sandbox Features
## Isolated & Cost-Controlled

- **Separate VPCs** per developer
- **Resource quotas** to control costs
- **Auto-destroy** after X hours
- **Clone production** configurations
- **Pre-configured** databases & services

---

# Slide 16: Security Built-In
## No More "We'll Add Security Later"

```bash
rig generate security
```

**Generates:**
- RBAC configurations
- Network policies
- Container security policies
- Compliance templates (SOC2, GDPR)
- Vulnerability scanning configs

---

# Slide 17: Infrastructure Drift Prevention
## Version Control Everything

### Before: 
- Manual console changes
- Undocumented modifications
- "It works on my machine"

### After:
- All changes through Git
- Automated drift detection
- Continuous reconciliation
